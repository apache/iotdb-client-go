Apache IoTDB (Database for Internet of Things) is an IoT native database with high performance for 
data management and analysis, deployable on the edge and the cloud. Due to its light-weight 
architecture, high performance and rich feature set together with its deep integration with 
Apache Hadoop, Spark and Flink, Apache IoTDB can meet the requirements of massive data storage, 
high-speed data ingestion and complex data analysis in the IoT industrial fields.
